# Dominos
## Usage
Created a Dominos.jar which is version 1 couldn't get version 2 to work so thats why their is only one jar file
##Dominos.jar
This verision is a string representations of the game domino mainly displayed in the command line that shows
the toal number of dominos in the boneyard giving the player three options to select from. In order to progress into
the game the player must chose the options when prompted so I am already assumming that the player knows how to play the 
game. If the player gets tired of play with the Computer he has the option to quit. 

## Bugs
- Version 1 placing a domino towards the left of the row from the output string will create an error for the next domino 
being placed their.
- Version 2 I had an issue with javafx not recognizing that I had the right files in order for my code to work. I also created a package 2
meaning that would be version 2 but everytime I try to calls something from another class I would see that I am using version 1 and need version 2
and vice versa this would keep happening making my program to be ever more faulty creating more bugs on the way.
